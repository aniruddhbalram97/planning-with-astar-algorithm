## Motion Planning with A* Algorithm

### Description:
- A* algorithm finds the optimal shortest path to the goal from initial point.
- It's different from Dijkstra in the sense that A* takes heuristic into account along with weighted movement
- It offers a fast and optimal solution by reducing the exploration space.
- The outcome of this project is for self-learning to understand the working of A* algorithm and it's application for planning of non-holonomic robots.

### Instructions to run:

```
# Enter the project directory:
cd <project_directory>

# Create a test_case folder
mkdir test_case

# Run the main script
python3 main.py
```

### Demo
- initial_node: [15, 30, 30]
- goal_node: [190, 20, 60]
