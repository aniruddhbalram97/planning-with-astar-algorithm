## Motion Planning with A* Algorithm

### Description:
- A* algorithm finds the optimal shortest path to the goal from initial point.
- It's different from Dijkstra in the sense that A* takes heuristic into account along with weighted movement
- It offers a fast and optimal solution by reducing the exploration space.
- The outcome of this project is for self-learning to understand the working of A* algorithm and it's application for planning of non-holonomic robots.
